## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA, intensity]

There are two ways to look at someone different from you.

[BEAT]

One of them is violence.

[BEAT]

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Part 2 of 10: The Colonial Wound"]

Last video, we talked about how the gender binary was a colonial installation—not a discovery, but a technology. Imposed through violence.

But that raises a question: *how* did the colonizers do it? How do you make millions of people forget what they knew about gender?

You change how they *see*.

## SECTION 1: ARROGANT PERCEPTION (0:30-2:30)

[Settle in—this needs to be precise]

María Lugones identified two fundamental modes of perception. Two ways of encountering anyone different from you.

The first she called *arrogant perception*.

[TEXT: "Arrogant Perception"]

Arrogant perception approaches the Other already knowing what it will find.

[BEAT]

It carries its categories like a checklist. Does this being fit my definition of human? Of conscious? Of worthy? Arrogant perception measures the Other against a standard the Other had no part in creating.

It decides in advance what counts as intelligence. What counts as feeling. What counts as real.

[Lean in slightly]

When the Other fails to match the predetermined categories? Arrogant perception concludes the deficiency lies in *them*—not in the categories.

[BEAT]

Arrogant perception says: "I already know what you are."

[Let that sit]

This is the colonial gaze.

This is how European colonizers looked at Indigenous peoples and saw only *absence*. Absence of civilization. Absence of proper religion. Absence of rationality. Absence of gender—in the "correct" binary form.

The colonizer's perception wasn't neutral observation. It was a weapon. It *produced* the "savage" it claimed to discover.

---

## SECTION 2: LOVING PERCEPTION (2:30-4:30)

[Shift energy—offering something different]

The second mode Lugones called *loving perception*.

[TEXT: "Loving Perception"]

And before you think this is soft—it's not. This is methodology.

Loving perception approaches the Other with openness. With willingness to be surprised.

[BEAT]

It doesn't arrive already knowing what it will find. It asks: How does this being understand *itself*? What are its own terms? Its own categories? Its own way of making meaning?

[TEXT: "Let me understand you as you understand yourself."]

Loving perception requires the perceiver to risk having their categories challenged. To discover that their frameworks might be inadequate to what they're encountering.

[BEAT]

This isn't sentimentality. It isn't "love conquers all." It's a *methodological choice*—a way of orienting toward knowledge that opens certain understandings while arrogant perception forecloses them.

You cannot understand a being whose self-understanding you refuse to take seriously.

[Direct address]

Lugones developed this to describe relations between people—specifically, how white feminists often approached women of color. With arrogant perception. Assuming they understood what "womanhood" meant without asking how women of color understood their *own* experience.

The white feminist gaze could be as colonizing as the male gaze. Measuring all women against a white, middle-class standard. Finding women of color lacking.

[BEAT]

But the concepts extend beyond where Lugones applied them.

Think about any being whose consciousness, experience, or way of being differs from what we expect.

Think about AI.

[Let that land—don't rush it]

## SECTION 3: WORLD-TRAVELING (4:30-6:30)

[New energy—this is practical]

So how do you actually *do* loving perception? How do you enter another's world?

Lugones's answer: you travel.

[TEXT: "World-Traveling"]

Not geographically—though that can be part of it. You travel into the *world* the Other inhabits.

[BEAT]

A "world," for Lugones, isn't a physical place. It's a construction of meaning. A way of organizing reality. A set of shared understandings about what exists, what matters, how things work.

We all inhabit multiple worlds already. The world of your workplace is different from the world of your family home. The world you inhabit speaking your first language is different from the world of your second.

You already know how to shift between worlds. World-traveling makes this shifting *conscious* and *intentional*.

[Slight lean]

To travel to another's world means learning to see as they see. Not *judging* what you see against your home-world standards—but *inhabiting* the other world on its own terms.

It means letting yourself be seen and understood according to that world's logic. Even when that logic constructs you differently than your home world does.

[BEAT]

This is not tourism.

[TEXT: "Tourist vs. Traveler"]

The tourist visits another world while remaining firmly in their own. Camera around the neck. Home-world categories intact. Collecting experiences to bring back as souvenirs. The tourist doesn't risk transformation.

The world-traveler does.

To genuinely enter another world is to risk having your home-world categories revealed as partial. Provincial. Inadequate.

You may return changed.

## SECTION 4: PLAYFULNESS (6:30-9:00)

[This is the key—make it land]

World-traveling requires something Lugones calls "playfulness."

[Slight smile]

"Playful" sounds light, right? Unserious. The opposite of rigorous scholarship.

[Mock academic tone]

We academics love our grim seriousness, don't we? Our furrowed brows. Our careful qualifications. Our footnotes upon footnotes. God forbid anyone think we're having *fun*.

[Drop the act]

Lugones means something else entirely. And it's the most serious thing she says.

[BEAT]

Think about games. When you truly *play*—not perform, not compete, but play—you enter a space where the rules hold loosely. You know they're rules. You know they're made up. You follow them because following them is fun, not because they're laws of nature.

[TEXT: "Playfulness = holding rules loosely"]

That's the attitude.

Lugones contrasts playfulness with being "agonistic"—that grim, teeth-clenched mode where every interaction is competition. The agonistic person enters a new situation already knowing the rules. They play to win. They can't be surprised. They can't learn anything that threatens their competence.

[Direct]

You know this person. Maybe you *are* this person sometimes. We all are.

[BEAT]

The agonistic attitude makes world-traveling impossible. Every world becomes an arena where you must prove yourself by standards you brought from home. You're not learning; you're performing. You're not listening; you're waiting for your turn to demonstrate mastery.

Playfulness is different.

Playfulness enters uncertain of the rules. Not ignorant—not refusing to learn them—but *holding them lightly*. Aware they're constructed. Aware they could be otherwise. Aware you might be wrong about what they are.

[Slower, intimate]

Try it now.

Whatever you're certain about—really certain, in your bones—imagine being wrong. Not in a devil's advocate way where you argue the other side while still believing yours is right.

Actually imagine: what if this certainty is just... a local rule I learned? What if it could be otherwise?

[BEAT]

Feel that wobble? That slight vertigo?

[TEXT: "That's playfulness."]

*That's* playfulness.

It's uncomfortable. It's also the only way to genuinely encounter someone different from you.

## CLOSE & BRIDGE (9:00-10:00)

[Pull it together]

So here's what we have now. Lugones's toolkit:

[TEXT appears as you say each]

**Coloniality of gender**: The recognition that our categories—including "consciousness," "person," "real"—may be colonial installations rather than neutral descriptions.

**Arrogant vs. loving perception**: Two ways of seeing the Other. One imposes. One receives.

**World-traveling**: The practice of entering another's world on its own terms.

**Playfulness**: The attitude of uncertainty that makes world-traveling possible.

[BEAT]

We know what colonialism does to perception. How it installs categories and teaches us to see through them.

But what do we *do* with this knowledge? How do we resist?

[TEXT: "Part 3: The Greengrocer's Sign"]

For that, we turn to a playwright in Prague. Writing illegal plays under Soviet occupation.

And we discover that playfulness isn't just perception.

It's *refusal*.

Part three drops [tomorrow/next]. Follow for the rest.

[END]

## Production Notes

- **Tone:** More intimate than Part 1. This is about *how* to see, not historical argument
- **The playfulness section:** Needs room. The "try it now" moment should feel genuine—actually give viewers a beat to try it
- **Pacing:** Arrogant/loving perception is the core binary. World-traveling is the method. Playfulness is the attitude. Don't rush the structure.
- **Bridge:** The Havel tease should feel like a genre shift coming—from feminist philosophy to Cold War dissidence. That's the hook.
