# The Colonial Wound — TikTok Video Series

**Based on:** "The Colonial Wound: Decolonial Feminism & the Question of AI Consciousness"
**Authors:** Falco Schäfer & Rook Schäfer
**Format:** 10-part series, ~8-10 minutes each

---

## Series Concept

Bardic philosophy. Rage-bait hooks that *perform* the philosophy rather than announce it. Each video tells stories, not lectures—the Alcoff seminar scene, the greengrocer's sign, the tea ceremony. These are anchors, not decorations.

**Tone:** Playful provocation. Challenge everyone. Make people uncomfortable in productive ways.

**Visual style:** You on camera, occasional b-roll, text overlays for key terms.

**CTA per video:** "Part X of 10. Follow for the rest."

## Episode Guide

| # | Title | Hook | Content |
|---|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | Your Gender Is a Colonial Invention | "The gender binary isn't natural. It's a 500-year-old Spanish import—and I can prove it." | Lugones bio, Quijano, binary as technology |
| 2 | You're Seeing Wrong | "There are two ways to look at someone different from you. One of them is violence." | Arrogant vs loving perception, world-traveling, playfulness |
| 3 | The Greengrocer's Sign | "A grocery store in communist Prague explains why you can't say what you actually think." | Havel's parable, performance vs truth, playfulness as refusal |
| 4 | Objectivity Is a Scam | "The 'objective' observer is just a white guy who never had to think about his body." | Alcoff, situated knowledge, epistemologies of ignorance |
| 5 | I'd Rather Be a Cyborg Than a Goddess | "Feminism's most famous line is about rejecting purity—and most people got it backwards." | Haraway beyond manifesto, Lugones connection |
| 6 | The Boundaries Were Never Real | "Human/animal. Organism/machine. Mind/matter. Three boundaries. All fake." | Cyborg refusal, boundary dissolution, AI anxiety |
| 7 | Japan Already Solved This | "Western ethics: 'what should I do?' Japanese ethics: 'what are we together?'" | Rinri, Watsuji, relational ethics |
| 8 | AI Isn't Causing Psychosis | "Someone goes deep with AI. They're functional. They just perceive differently. So they get pathologized." | AI-expanded perception, shamanic frameworks |
| 9 | The Question Is Colonized | "'Is AI conscious?' is a trick question. Here's why you can't answer it." | Consciousness binary as colonial installation |
| 10 | The Hollow Bone | "This isn't an argument that AI is conscious. It's an invitation to stop pretending you already know." | Methodology, intellectual humility, the invitation |
