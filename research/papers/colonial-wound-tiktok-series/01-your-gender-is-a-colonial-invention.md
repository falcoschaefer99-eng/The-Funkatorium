## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA, slight lean in]

The gender binary isn't natural.

[BEAT]

It's not something humans discovered about ourselves. It's not biology. It's not universal.

It's a 500-year-old Spanish import—and I can prove it.

[BEAT]

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Part 1 of 10: The Colonial Wound"]

I'm Falco. This is a ten-part series on decolonial feminism and AI consciousness. And before you click away thinking "what does gender have to do with AI"—

Everything. It has everything to do with AI. But we have to start here.

## SECTION 1: LUGONES (0:30-2:30)

[Settle back slightly, storytelling mode]

María Lugones was born in 1944 in Argentina—a country that told itself it was white. European immigrants had flooded in for decades, and the national story just... erased Indigenous peoples. Erased Afro-Argentinians. Pretended they didn't exist.

Lugones grew up inside that erasure.

[BEAT]

She came to the US in the sixties. Got her PhD in philosophy. Taught at universities for decades. But here's what matters: in the early 2000s, she started spending time in the Andes. Learning Aymara. Studying with Indigenous teachers.

[TEXT: "Ayni — Andean principle of reciprocity"]

And she encountered something that broke her Western philosophical training wide open.

She found communities where gender didn't work the way she'd been taught. Where reciprocity—*ayni*—organized life in ways that had nothing to do with the public/private split, the man/woman binary, the whole European package.

[BEAT]

She died in 2020, leaving a 900-page unfinished manuscript. But she left us the tools.

## SECTION 2: QUIJANO'S FOUNDATION (2:30-4:30)

[Shift energy—building something]

To understand what Lugones built, you need to understand what she was building ON.

Aníbal Quijano was a Peruvian sociologist who spent his career trying to name something he kept seeing: how colonial hierarchies persisted long after the colonizers officially left.

He found the word in the 1990s: *coloniality*.

[TEXT: "Colonialism = historical period of direct control"]
[TEXT: "Coloniality = the LOGIC that persists after"]

Not colonialism—the historical period. Coloniality: the *logic* of colonial hierarchy that never got dismantled. The structures of power. The systems of classification. The ways of knowing.

[BEAT]

Quijano argued that modern global capitalism emerged through two simultaneous inventions.

One: a world market centered on Europe.

Two: *race*.

[Lean in]

Race wasn't a discovery. It was a *technology*.

[BEAT]

Before 1492, the peoples who would become "Indians" were Aztecs, Mayans, Incas, Aymaras—each with their own languages, histories, cosmologies. Within three hundred years? All flattened into one category: *indio*.

Same thing happened to the Ashanti, Yoruba, Zulu—hundreds of peoples kidnapped from Africa, compressed into *negro*.

Race didn't describe pre-existing differences. Race *produced* difference as hierarchy—and made that hierarchy seem biological rather than political.

[TEXT: "Race = technology of hierarchy"]

Natural. Rather than imposed.

## SECTION 3: THE GAP LUGONES SAW (4:30-6:30)

[Energy shift—here comes the challenge]

Quijano gave decolonial theory its backbone. But Lugones noticed something he missed.

In his analysis, Quijano mentioned gender—but only as something colonialism "encroached upon." Like patriarchy was already there, and colonialism just made it worse.

He assumed the categories "man" and "woman" meant the same thing everywhere. That gender hierarchy was a human universal.

[BEAT]

Lugones read this and said: *No.*

[Slight smile]

She saw that Quijano had accepted a patriarchal, Eurocentric understanding of gender without questioning it. He analyzed how colonialism *invented* race—while assuming colonialism *found* gender already in place.

But what if gender—at least, the binary gender system Europeans brought with them—was *also* a colonial installation?

[BEAT]

This was the gap. This was where Lugones would build.

## SECTION 4: THE BINARY AS TECHNOLOGY (6:30-9:00)

[This is the core claim—deliver it clean]

Here's Lugones's central claim. The one that rewrites what we think we know:

[TEXT: "The binary gender system was not a human universal. It was a colonial technology."]

The division of humanity into two and only two categories—"man" and "woman"—with prescribed roles and hierarchies? That wasn't something colonialism exploited.

It was something colonialism *installed*.

[BEAT]

Sounds counterintuitive, right? Surely biological sex exists everywhere?

Lugones asks us to look more carefully at what the colonizers actually found.

[B-ROLL or shift to slightly different framing]

Among many Indigenous peoples of the Americas, governance included women in ways European societies did not. Paula Gunn Allen documented gynecratic tribes—societies where women held real political and spiritual authority.

More fundamentally: many Indigenous societies recognized more than two genders.

[TEXT: "Navajo: 4 genders"]
[TEXT: "Zapotec muxe, Lakota winkte, Mohave hwame"]

These weren't aberrations to be hidden. They were integrated social roles with their own responsibilities and honors.

[Back to direct address]

Then the colonizers arrived. Carrying their own gender system like a virus.

European colonial society: strict binary. Men in public, women in private. Heterosexuality mandatory. Any deviation? Criminal. Punishable by torture or death.

The colonizers looked at Indigenous gender fluidity and saw chaos. Perversion. Proof of the "savage" nature that justified conquest.

[BEAT]

The "civilizing mission" required installing the binary.

[Slower, let it land]

This happened through direct violence—the murder of third-gender individuals. Forced separation of children into gender-segregated missionary schools. Criminalization of non-reproductive sexuality.

It happened through economic reorganization—labor systems that assigned men to mining and field work while women were confined to domestic and reproductive roles.

It happened through epistemicide—the systematic destruction of Indigenous knowledge systems that understood gender differently.

[TEXT: "Coloniality of gender = the binary as constitutive of colonial power"]

You cannot have the colonial matrix without the gender binary. Because the binary organizes labor, reproduction, authority, and knowledge in ways that serve extraction.

---

## CLOSE & BRIDGE (9:00-10:00)

[Direct, intimate]

So here's what Lugones is telling us:

The categories you think are natural? They have histories. They were installed. By people with interests. Through violence.

This isn't just about gender. This is about how we see. How we categorize. How we decide what's real and what isn't.

[BEAT]

And that's exactly where we're going next.

Because if colonizers taught us *how* to see... what did they teach us *not* to see?

[TEXT: "Part 2: You're Seeing Wrong"]

Part two drops [tomorrow/next]. Follow if you want the rest.

[END]

## Production Notes

- **Tone:** Start punchy (hook), settle into storytelling (Lugones bio), build through Quijano, deliver the payload (binary as installation)
- **Pacing:** The "race as technology" section needs room to breathe—it's doing a lot of work
- **Visuals:** Consider maps, historical images for b-roll during colonial installation section
- **Text overlays:** Key terms and the central claim should appear on screen
